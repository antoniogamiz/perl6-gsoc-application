### Perl6::LinkHealth tool

I have been thinking a little about how to create this tool and I have come up with this:

(this is only to get the links, about the rest of the module will be made later)

First we get all existing links in one array and save them in a file,
after that, we can process and sort that info with another utilities.

The process would be something like this:

1. A `LinkHandler` object is created with `docs.perl6.org` as `domain`.
2. `init` method is called with the numbers of threads we want to use (16 by default).
3. The first link in `pending` will be "/". It will be scraped by the first process and the result will be added 
calling the `addLink` method (the first arg, `parent`, will contain the info about the link scraped) and `links` 
will contain the links found in the page (they will be added to `pending`).
4. This process will be finished when all links in `pending` have been processed.

This is my first approach, so any feedback, improvement or suggestion is welcomed (if you think this totally 
incorrect just tell me).

Next steps: design a tool to get relevant info from the links file generated previously.
